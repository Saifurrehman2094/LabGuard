# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive two-factor authentication (2FA) system using face recognition for a student dashboard in an Electron.js desktop application. The system combines traditional username/password authentication with biometric face verification, providing enhanced security for exam monitoring environments. The system includes an admin dashboard for user management and supports bulk user enrollment via CSV files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a student, I want to log in using my username and password followed by face verification, so that my identity is securely authenticated before accessing the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid username and password THEN the system SHALL verify credentials against the database
2. WHEN credential verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically activate the webcam for face verification
3. WHEN the webcam opens THEN the system SHALL display a bounding box or frame for face alignment guidance
4. WHEN a face is detected within the frame THEN the system SHALL capture the face image and extract embeddings
5. WHEN face embeddings are extracted THEN the system SHALL compare them with stored embeddings in the database
6. IF the embedding distance is below the matching threshold (< 0.45) THEN the system SHALL grant access to the dashboard
7. IF the embedding distance exceeds the threshold THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an error message

### Requirement 2: Face Recognition Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use reliable face recognition technology, so that biometric authentication is accurate and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load @vladmandic/face-api models (SSD MobileNet, face landmarks, face recognition)
2. WHEN face detection is performed THEN the system SHALL use navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() to access the webcam
3. WHEN face embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL use face-api.js face recognition models
4. WHEN embeddings are compared THEN the system SHALL calculate Euclidean distance between stored and captured embeddings
5. WHEN face recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for missing camera, failed detection, or database issues

### Requirement 3: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want face embeddings to be securely stored and retrieved from the database, so that user biometric data is properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is enrolled THEN the system SHALL store face embeddings as binary data in the SQLite database
2. WHEN face verification occurs THEN the system SHALL retrieve stored embeddings for the authenticated user
3. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN they SHALL be associated with the user's unique identifier
4. WHEN multiple embeddings are captured during registration THEN the system SHALL average them for improved accuracy
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 4: User Interface States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the authentication process, so that I understand what the system is doing at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN face capture begins THEN the system SHALL display "Capturing face..." status
2. WHEN face verification is processing THEN the system SHALL display "Verifying..." status
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL display "Access Granted" message
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display "Access Denied" message
5. WHEN real-time face detection is active THEN the system SHALL show bounding box feedback on canvas
6. WHEN camera access is requested THEN the system SHALL show appropriate permission prompts

### Requirement 5: Admin Dashboard

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard to manage users and their data, so that I can efficiently control system access and user enrollment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display the admin dashboard with user management options
2. WHEN viewing users THEN the admin SHALL see a list of all enrolled users with their details
3. WHEN enrolling a single user THEN the admin SHALL be able to enter user details and capture face biometrics
4. WHEN removing a user THEN the admin SHALL be able to delete user data including face embeddings
5. WHEN modifying user data THEN the admin SHALL be able to update user information and re-enroll face data
6. WHEN bulk enrollment is needed THEN the admin SHALL be able to upload a CSV file with multiple user records

### Requirement 6: CSV Bulk Enrollment

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to enroll multiple users at once using a CSV file, so that I can efficiently manage large numbers of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and required columns
2. WHEN processing CSV data THEN the system SHALL create user accounts for each valid record
3. WHEN CSV processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed enrollments
4. WHEN CSV contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL skip invalid records and report errors
5. WHEN bulk enrollment occurs THEN users SHALL be marked as requiring face registration on first login

### Requirement 7: Simplified Login Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple login interface with just username and password fields, so that the authentication process is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login page loads THEN it SHALL display only username field, password field, and login button
2. WHEN user credentials are submitted THEN the system SHALL determine user role from database records
3. WHEN role is determined THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate dashboard (student/teacher/admin)
4. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display generic error message without revealing specific failure reason
5. WHEN hardcoded user storage exists THEN it SHALL be removed from the codebase

### Requirement 8: IPC Communication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure communication between Electron processes, so that sensitive operations are properly isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN face recognition operations occur THEN they SHALL use IPC bridge (ipcRenderer/ipcMain) for process communication
2. WHEN database operations are requested THEN they SHALL be handled in the main process
3. WHEN webcam access is needed THEN renderer process SHALL request permission through IPC
4. WHEN face embeddings are processed THEN they SHALL be securely transmitted between processes
5. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN it SHALL not be exposed to the renderer process unnecessarily

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and security measures, so that the system is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN camera access is denied THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and fallback options
2. WHEN face detection fails THEN the system SHALL allow retry attempts with clear guidance
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and attempt reconnection
4. WHEN face embeddings cannot be extracted THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and alternative options
5. WHEN matching threshold is configurable THEN admin SHALL be able to adjust sensitivity settings

### Requirement 10: Model Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want face-api.js models to be properly managed and loaded, so that face recognition functionality works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load required face-api.js models from the models directory
2. WHEN models are missing THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and download instructions
3. WHEN models are loaded THEN the system SHALL verify model integrity and compatibility
4. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or graceful degradation
5. WHEN models directory exists THEN it SHALL contain SSD MobileNet, face landmarks, and face recognition models
